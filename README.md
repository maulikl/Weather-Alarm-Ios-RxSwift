# weather-alarm-ios-rxswift
Full function weather alarm written in RxSwift (now using Xcode7.3 and swift2.2).       
Since [my previous try](https://github.com/natsu1211/Alarm-ios-swift) has so many anti-patterns and it's a pain to reflect data changes to UI without a framework like ReactiveX, I decide to rewrite it totally.
